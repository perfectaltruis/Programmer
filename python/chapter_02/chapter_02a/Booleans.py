# Boolean Data Type

# Variables
is_sunny = True
is_raining = False

# Explanation
# Boolean data type represents truth values. It can have two possible values: True or False.
# Booleans are commonly used in conditional statements and control flow to make decisions based on conditions.

# Example
# Checking weather conditions
print("Is it sunny today?", is_sunny)
print("Is it raining today?", is_raining)

# Conditional statement
if is_sunny:
    print("Enjoy the sunny weather!")
else:
    print("Don't forget to carry an umbrella!")

# In this example:
# - We have two boolean variables is_sunny and is_raining initialized with True and False, respectively.
# - We print the current weather conditions using these boolean variables.
# - We use a conditional statement to check if it's sunny, and based on the result, we provide a corresponding message.
