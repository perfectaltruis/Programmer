# Assignment Operators Examples with Descriptive Variable Names

# Assigning initial value
current_value = 5
print("Initial value:", current_value)

# +=
current_value += 3  # Equivalent to: current_value = current_value + 3
print("After addition, current value is:", current_value)

# -=
current_value -= 3  # Equivalent to: current_value = current_value - 3
print("After subtraction, current value is:", current_value)

# *=
current_value *= 3  # Equivalent to: current_value = current_value * 3
print("After multiplication, current value is:", current_value)

# /=
current_value /= 3  # Equivalent to: current_value = current_value / 3
print("After division, current value is:", current_value)

# %=
current_value %= 3  # Equivalent to: current_value = current_value % 3
print("After modulus, current value is:", current_value)

# //=
current_value //= 3  # Equivalent to: current_value = current_value // 3
print("After floor division, current value is:", current_value)

# **=
current_value = 5  # Resetting current value to 5
current_value **= 3  # Equivalent to: current_value = current_value ** 3
print("After exponentiation, current value is:", current_value)

# &=
current_value = 5  # Resetting current value to 5
current_value &= 3  # Equivalent to: current_value = current_value & 3
print("After bitwise AND, current value is:", current_value)

# |=
current_value = 5  # Resetting current value to 5
current_value |= 3  # Equivalent to: current_value = current_value | 3
print("After bitwise OR, current value is:", current_value)

# ^=
current_value = 5  # Resetting current value to 5
current_value ^= 3  # Equivalent to: current_value = current_value ^ 3
print("After bitwise XOR, current value is:", current_value)

# >>=
current_value = 5  # Resetting current value to 5
current_value >>= 1  # Equivalent to: current_value = current_value >> 1
print("After right shift, current value is:", current_value)

# <<=
current_value = 5  # Resetting current value to 5
current_value <<= 1  # Equivalent to: current_value = current_value << 1
print("After left shift, current value is:", current_value)


# Assignment operators in Python are used to assign values to variables and modify the value of variables
# based on arithmetic or bitwise operations. Here's how each assignment operator works using the provided example:
#
#     Assign (=):
#         Used to assign a value to a variable.
#         Example: current_value = 5
#
#     Add and Assign (+=):
#         Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
#         Example: current_value += 3 is equivalent to current_value = current_value + 3
#
#     Subtract and Assign (-=):
#         Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
#         Example: current_value -= 3 is equivalent to current_value = current_value - 3
#
#     Multiply and Assign (*=):
#         Multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
#         Example: current_value *= 3 is equivalent to current_value = current_value * 3
#
#     Divide and Assign (/=):
#         Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
#         Example: current_value /= 3 is equivalent to current_value = current_value / 3
#
#     Floor Divide and Assign (//=):
#         Performs floor division on the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
#         Example: current_value //= 3 is equivalent to current_value = current_value // 3
#
#     Modulus and Assign (%=):
#         Calculates the remainder of the division of the left operand
#         by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
#         Example: current_value %= 3 is equivalent to current_value = current_value % 3
#
#     Exponential and Assign (=):**
#         Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
#         Example: current_value **= 3 is equivalent to current_value = current_value ** 3
#
#     Bitwise AND and Assign (&=), OR and Assign (|=), XOR and Assign (^=):
#         Performs bitwise AND/OR/XOR operation between the left and right
#         operands and assigns the result to the left operand.
#         Example: current_value &= 3 is equivalent to current_value = current_value & 3
#
#     Right Shift and Assign (>>=), Left Shift and Assign (<<=):
#         Shifts the bits of the left operand right/left by the number of
#         positions specified by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
#         Example: current_value >>= 1 is equivalent to current_value = current_value >> 1
#
# Assignment operator provide a concise way to modify variable values in Python,making code more readable and efficient
