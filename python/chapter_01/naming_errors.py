# ERRORS RELATED TO VARIABLE NAMES
# Errors related to variable names in Python typically occur when the variable names do not adhere to the rules and
# conventions of Python syntax. Here are some common errors related to variable names:
#
# SyntaxError: This error occurs if the variable name contains invalid characters or violates Python's naming rules.
# For example:
#
# 123variable = 10  # Variable name starts with a digit
#
# NameError:
# This error occurs when you try to access a variable that hasn't been defined or is misspelled. For example:
#
# print(my_variable)  # Variable 'my_variable' is not defined
#
# TypeError:
# While not directly related to variable names, using inappropriate variable names might lead to
# TypeErrors if the variable's intended purpose is misunderstood. For example:
#
# number = 'Hello'  # Variable name suggests a number, but it contains a string
# number + 5  # This would raise a TypeError
#
# Reserved Keyword Conflict: If you accidentally use a reserved keyword as a variable name, it will result in syntax
# errors or unexpected behavior. For example:
#
#
# import = 10  # 'import' is a reserved keyword
#
# Incorrect Case Usage:
# Python variable names are case-sensitive. Using different cases for the same variable name
# can lead to confusion or errors. For example:
#
#     myVariable = 5
#     print(MyVariable)  # This would result in a NameError
#
# To avoid these errors, ensure that your variable names adhere to Python's naming rules, avoid using reserved
# keywords, use meaningful and descriptive names, and maintain consistent naming conventions throughout your code.
