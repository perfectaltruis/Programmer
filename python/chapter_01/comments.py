# HOW TO RUN PYTHON CODES IN TERMINAL, AND EDITOR. WHAT IS INDENTATION IN PYTHON?
# WHAT IS COMMENT? HOW TO WRITE COMMENTS IN PYTHON.


# Python as I said before it can be executed from the command line or py createing a file with .py extension and
# write your code there, save the file. To run python programms from the python console follow the following steps i.
# Open your terminal and type python then press return key(Enter) ii. At that console start typing your python codes
# for example: print("Hello, World") Press Enter to see the output.

# To run and create python programs you can also create a file using a command line interface or your favorite
# text editor and start writing codes on the file, save the file and turn to your terminal again and run this
# command python filename to see the result of your codes.


# Python Indentation
#  refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
# Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only,
# the indentation in Python is very important. Python will give you an error if you skip indentation
# The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.
# Remember you have to use the same number of indentation otherwise python will arise an error.

# COMMENTS IN PYTHON. ALL OF THE ABOVE ARE COMMENTS: COMMENTS START WITH # A HASH TAG AND THERE IS NO WAY TO WRITE
# MULTILINE COMMENT IN PYTHON IF YOU NEED TO DO IT JUST INSERT A HASH TAG AT EACH LINE YOU CAN ALSO CREATE COMMENT BY
# USING DOC STRINGS, i.e CREATE A LONG LINE BUT INSERT IT IN TRIPLE QUOTES, PYTHON WILL IGNORE IT.
# COMMENTS CAN BE PLACED AT THE TOP OR AT THE END OF THE LINE AS WELL

print("Hey! Probably you did not understand anything here")  # this is a comment.
print("Do not worry, soon I will take you there trust in me")
print("Please read all in this file too.")

# REASONS WHY COMMENT ARE NEEDED AND YOU SHOULD INSERT COMMENTS IN YOUR CODE TOO:
# Comments in programming languages serve several important purposes, contributing to code readability, maintainability,
# and collaboration. Here are five reasons why comments are essential in any programming language:
#
# Code Documentation:
# Comments provide a way to document code, explaining its purpose, functionality, and usage. This
# documentation is invaluable for developers who need to understand and work with the code, especially if they didn't
# write it themselves or if some time has passed since it was written. Good documentation can significantly reduce
# the time it takes for developers to understand and modify code.
#
# Clarification and Explanation:
# Comments can clarify complex or non-obvious parts of the code, explaining the
# reasoning behind certain design decisions or implementation choices. They can help other developers understand the
# intent of the code and how it achieves its objectives. Comments can also serve as reminders for the original author
# or other developers about potential issues or improvements.
#
# Debugging and Troubleshooting:
# Comments can be used for debugging and troubleshooting purposes, providing insights
# into the code's behavior and helping identify potential bugs or errors. By describing the expected behavior at
# various points in the code, comments can assist in diagnosing problems and verifying that the code behaves as
# intended.
#
# Communication and Collaboration:
# Comments facilitate communication and collaboration among developers working on
# the same codebase. They allow developers to communicate ideas, share insights, and provide feedback on each other's
# code. Comments make it easier for multiple developers to collaborate effectively, even if they're working remotely
# or asynchronously.
#
# Future Maintenance and Enhancement:
# Comments play a crucial role in code maintenance and enhancement, particularly
# as projects evolve over time. They help future developers understand the code's structure, dependencies,
# and intended usage, making it easier to make changes, add new features, or fix bugs. Well-documented code with
# clear comments is more maintainable and adaptable to changing requirements.
