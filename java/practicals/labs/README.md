# Java Lab Programms

This project contains Java programs that correspond to problems and exercises typically found in C programming language practicals. While the problems are originally intended for C, they have been implemented in Java for practice and learning purposes.

## List of Files

### C Practical 1.pdf

- This file contains practical exercises typically encountered in C Practical 1 sessions.

### C Practical 2.pdf

- This file contains practical exercises typically encountered in C Practical 2 sessions.

### C Practical 4.pdf

- This file contains practical exercises typically encountered in C Practical 4 sessions.

### C Practical 5.pdf

- This file contains practical exercises typically encountered in C Practical 5 sessions.

## Lab Directories

- [**lab_01**: lab practicals for session one](lab_01)
- [**lab_02**: lab practicals for session two](lab_02)
- [**lab_04**: lab practicals for session four](lab_04)
- [**lab_05**: lab practicals for session five](lab_05)

Each lab directory contains exercises and examples related to the respective session topic.

## Note

While the labs focus on C programming concepts, they are implemented in Java to provide a more accessible learning experience, allowing learners to understand the underlying principles without getting bogged down in language-specific syntax.
